A simple utility, written in Go, for interacting with Salesforce.  Currently only specific functionality is implemented, 
and the output is defined by current requirements, however it can be easily extended to add further capabilities.

There is already a [Salesforce CLI available on the Salesforce website](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli#), but that doesn't currently support the V2 Bulk API.

## Authentication

Currently only the "username-password authorization flow" is supported.  Moving forward, the aim would be to support other authorization flows.

You can follow the [Quick Start](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/quickstart_oauth.htm) for setting up this authorization method.

The following environment variables are required for authentication:

* `CLIENT_ID` - consumer key from salesforce with access to the APIs
* `CLIENT_SECRET` - associated secret for the consumer key
* `USERNAME` - username with access to salesforce
* `PASSWORD` - associated password for that user
* `BASEURL` - base url for the salesforce tenant, e.g.  `https://mycompany--uat.my.salesforce.com`

You can also provide these in a `.sfcli` yaml file in your home directory or the directory in which you are running the command, e.g.:

```yaml
CLIENT_ID: fjafafhalsdjfhaksjÂ§hdf
CLIENT_SECRET: afjf34kjhsgljdgnajk
PASSWORD: supersecretpassword
USERNAME: me@mycompany.com
BASEURL: https://mycompany--uat.my.salesforce.com
```

You can have different files for different environments and specify which to use with the `--config` option, e.g. `sfcli --config .sfcli.dev`

For full command help simply use:

```sh
$ sfcli --help

## Bulk Uploads

Bulk uploads are achieved with the `sfcli bulk` command:

* `bulk status` : Get the status of a specific job
* `bulk upsert` : Bulk Upsert a CSV File

Each of the commands supports various flags as required which can be displayed within the help, e.g.:

```sh
$ sfcli bulk upsert --help

Bulk Upsert a CSV File

Usage:
  sfcli bulk upsert [flags]

Flags:
  -e, --external string   External ID Field
  -f, --file string       CSV File
  -h, --help              help for upsert
  -o, --object string     Type of Object for Insert, e.g. Account, Contact, Opportunity
```

### CSV Format

Use the correct column names as headers in the CSV.  These can be obtained from the "describe" endpoint for each object type.  
This CLI provides a `describe` command for some objects.

You can use relationship fields in the CSV so long as the `External ID` field is selected or, if it's a standard field,
its `idLookup` property is set to `true`.

For example, for an Account, you can use `Owner.Email` because `Owner` is a relationship to a "User" and the "User" 
`Email` field has its `idLookup` property set to true.  See the [Salesforce](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/relationship_fields_in_a_header_row__2_0.htm) documentation for more detail.
